# Note Taker

## Description
    - As a developer I wanted to be able to write down, save and delete notes as a form of organization to keep track of tasks that need to be completed.
    - This project was built to allow users to quickly enter tasks with tasks notes and save them in a database. Once a task is completed it can be removed from the database.
    - This project was able to solve how to use express.js to allow the back end of a web page, to read, write, append and delete items from a database, along with reading and sending the html data to the server, then taking the database information and using dom maniupulation to actively post the data into the web page.
    - This project allowed me to learn how to write routes for modularization, allowing the file structure and files to be much more organized and easier to read. I also learned how to use express to get html files and send them to the user. Uising express i also learned how to get, a json database and manipulate it by posting it, appending it, writing to it or deleteing items from it.
